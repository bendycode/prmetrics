# prmetrics - Development Roadmap

This document outlines future development plans for prmetrics. For completed work, see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). For architecture decisions and technical debt, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Priority Roadmap

### Phase 1: Code Quality & Stability (Next 2-4 weeks)

1. âœ… **Integrate Linting (RuboCop)** (In Progress)
   - âœ… Added RuboCop with Ruby Style Guide defaults
   - âœ… Configured as default rake task (runs before specs)
   - âœ… Generated .rubocop_todo.yml for gradual adoption
   - âœ… Added to CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
   - ðŸ”„ Incremental cleanup of existing violations (ongoing)

2. **Add Rails Best Practices**
   - Integrate rails_best_practices gem
   - Configure custom rules for the project
   - Add to CI/CD pipeline
   - Fix identified code smells and anti-patterns

### Phase 2: Architecture Improvements (4-8 weeks)

1. **Refactor GithubService**
   - Extract GithubApiClient
   - Create RateLimiter service
   - Build PullRequestImporter

2. **Standardize Database Statistics Caching**
   - âœ… **Add cached columns for PR aging metrics** (Completed)
     - Added `num_prs_late` column to cache PRs approved 8-27 days ago
     - Added `num_prs_stale` column to cache PRs approved 28+ days ago
     - Replaced generic "approved but unmerged" with actionable late/stale categories
     - All cached columns use historical `end_date` for consistency

   - **Continue caching pattern for remaining metrics**
     - Audit other dynamic calculations that should be cached for performance
     - Ensure `calculate_open_prs` populates and is used consistently
     - Verify all Week model cached columns are populated during sync

   - **Migrate dashboard from dynamic to cached calculations**
     - Update dashboard controller to use cached values exclusively
     - Remove complex `includes()` optimizations (no longer needed)
     - Simplify view templates to trust cached data

   - **Establish caching-first pattern for future metrics**
     - Document that all rake tasks must end with cache refresh
     - Create guidelines: new metrics should be cached unless real-time required
     - Rationale: Zero-cost caching since data only changes during controlled sync jobs

### Phase 3: Feature Enhancements (2-3 months)

1. **User Avatars**
   - Gravatar integration

     - Calculate median hours to merge (complement to existing average)
     - Cache median values in database following established caching pattern

   - **Enhance week show page with median data**
     - Display both average and median review metrics
     - Allow user to toggle between showing average-only, median-only, or both simultaneously

   - **UI/UX considerations**
     - Decide on default view (average-only for consistency vs both for completeness)
     - Design clear toggle interface that doesn't clutter existing layouts
     - Add tooltips explaining difference between average vs median metrics
     - Ensure responsive design works with additional chart complexity

### Phase 4: Performance & Scale (3-6 months)

1. **Caching Implementation**
