## Features

- Fetch pull request data from specified GitHub repositories
- Track metrics such as:
  - Open PRs
  - Draft PRs
  - PRs started
  - PRs merged
  - PRs canceled
  - Hours to first PR review
  - Hours to PR merge
- Store data locally to reduce API calls and enable offline analysis
- Incremental updates to minimize data transfer and processing time
- Multi-user access control with role-based authorization
- User invitation system for team collaboration

## Prerequisites

- Ruby 3.0.6 or later
- Rails 6.0 or later
- PostgreSQL
- GitHub Personal Access Token with repo scope

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/prmetrics.git
   cd prmetrics
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   bundle install
   ```

3. Set up the database:
   ```
   rails db:create db:migrate
   ```

4. Set your GitHub Personal Access Token:
   ```
   export GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```

5. Create an initial admin user:
   ```
   rails console
   User.create!(email: 'admin@example.com', password: 'password123', role: :admin)
   ```

## User Roles and Authorization

prmetrics implements role-based access control with two user roles:

### Admin Role
- **Full access** to all application features
- Can manage repositories (add, edit, delete)
- Can invite new users with either role
- Can view all data and metrics
- Default development login: `admin@example.com` / `password123`

### Regular User Role
- **Read-only access** to repository data and metrics
- Cannot manage repositories or invite users
- Can view dashboards and reports
- Suitable for team members who need visibility but not management access

### Authorization Model
The application uses [Pundit](https://github.com/varvet/pundit) for authorization:
- `RepositoryPolicy` - Controls repository management access
- `UserPolicy` - Controls user management and invitation features
- All controller actions are properly authorized
- UI elements are conditionally shown based on user permissions

### User Management
- Admins can invite new users via the `/users/invitations/new` page
- Invited users receive email invitations to set up their accounts
- Role assignment happens during the invitation process
- Users authenticate via email/password through Devise

## Usage

### Unified Sync (Recommended)

The unified sync command combines PR fetching, week generation, and statistics updates into a single command with real-time progress:

```
# Both syntaxes work:
rake sync:repository[owner/repo]
rake sync:repository owner/repo
```

For a full sync (all PRs, not just recent updates):

```
FETCH_ALL=true rake sync:repository[owner/repo]
FETCH_ALL=true rake sync:repository owner/repo
```

Additional sync commands:

```
# Check sync status for a repository (both syntaxes work)
rake sync:status[owner/repo]
rake sync:status owner/repo

# List all repositories and their sync status
rake sync:list

# Run sync in background (requires Sidekiq, both syntaxes work)
rake sync:repository_async[owner/repo]
rake sync:repository_async owner/repo
```

### Legacy Commands

Individual commands are still available but the unified sync is recommended:

```
# Fetch pull requests only
rake github:fetch_pull_requests REPO=owner/repo

# Generate week records
rake weeks:generate

# Update statistics
rake weeks:update_stats
```
